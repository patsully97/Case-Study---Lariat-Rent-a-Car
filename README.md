# Case-Study---Lariat-Rent-a-Car
In this case study, I analyzed a dataset from the fictional company Lariat and used my analysis to make two recommendations.
In order to analyze the data, I made use of a number of Excel functions as follows:

I extensively used INDEX/MATCH to consolidate data from columns across different worksheets.

By using mathematical functions including SUMIF and COUNTIF, I was able to determine financial data such as cost per transaction of individual vehicles (worksheet carid_staging), as well as profitability by location (worksheet location_staging).

Based on the financial data gathered through these functions, I developed two possible strategies for Lariat to pursue:

Strategy 1: Remove the three least profitable models, replacing them with the three most profitabe.

Strategy 2: Build three new dealerships at the three most profitable locations.*

Both strategies are visible from the "Dashboard" worksheet, and each strategy's impact on revenue, cost, and profit can be viewed by pressing the buttons on the interactive filter.

*Strategy 2 assumes that the cost of building new facilities will be negligible in the long term.
